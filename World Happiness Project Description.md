# How Happy is the World? A Model for World Happiness

The data for this project is sourced from The World Happiness Report. 
Happiness has been declared by the UN to be a fundamental human goal. 
As such an important yet abstract phenomenon, I was interested to explore how happiness is experienced across the world, 
to what extent different variables influence happiness, and how well if at all, happiness can be predicted based on those variables. 
In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis to visualise and draw key insights on world happiness for the data period 2015-2021.

I apply a range of machine learning techniques to build and determine the best predictive model for happiness and evaluate relative feature importances. 
Modelling techniques cover:

- Linear regression
- Ensembling
- Deep Learning (Neural Networks)
- Clustering
- Classification
